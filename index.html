		<h2>My backgroud 🌍</h2>
		<p>
			I was born in France and I come from a multicultural family. My father is Sri Lankan and my mother is Lithuanian. I speak french, english, singhalese, lithuanian and spanish.
			I have lived in two countries other than France: in Sri Lanka for 4 years and in London for 2 years. 
			These years living in other countries really gave me the opportunity to learn new things. This has taught me to respect everyone and understand cultural diversity.
			I have also traveled a lot, from Asia, to the Middle East, to Europe, which developed my language skills, helping me to be very open minded, embracing new cultures and understanding different people.
